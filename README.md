## Getting Started 🏄🏽

1️⃣ Open the command terminal and go to the directory you want this project to live, once there copy and paste this command to clone the project down to your local machine

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/dallenpyrah/huddle-frontend.git
```

2️⃣ After the project is done cloning down, run this npm command next to install all the dependencies 

```powershell
npm i
```

3️⃣ Open the project in your IDE of choice - we use VSCode or Webstorm here at Huddle 😄

4️⃣ In order to start the project you will need a command for that, here are a list of commands and what they do 

```jsx
npm run start // starts the application without hot reload
npm run build // creates a production ready copy of the application
npm run dev // starts the application with hot reload enabled 
npm run lint // lints the application looking for any style errors 
```

5️⃣ Lastly, don’t forget to start the huddle-api which handles all server side requests, if you don’t know what that is here is a link to the repository
